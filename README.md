use the html file thats in the repo with this read me. we will be creating a back end to support whats here. once we've done that we will containerize it. make that web interface connectable. the backend you build will need to have a dockerized server and a dockerized client. these will need to be able to connect over IP. The server will need to track users properly along with their personalied settings. which means a database some where. likely in a seperate container. we'll want persistent storage for the users and chat history. the end result will be more geared towards social media. this is a gaming focused community site. Make sure to theme everything F7Lans or F7 for short name. we'll need an admin user to manage the system. it will need to support oath and https. but these will be optional.
